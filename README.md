# 🌱 Time-Series Crop Growth Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

Monitoring crop growth over time is essential for assessing plant health, identifying stress patterns, and enabling data-driven agricultural decisions.

This project implements a **time-series data analysis pipeline** that processes sequential crop images, extracts vegetation-related features, and analyzes growth trends across time.  
The emphasis is on **data science fundamentals, feature engineering, and structured data outputs**, rather than black-box modeling.
